### Abstract

In the early 2000s, there was a minor flare-up in the history of physics due to the article by C. Monstein and J.P. Wesley (Monstein & Wesley, 2002), when they claimed to have experimentally supported the existence of longitudinal electromagnetic waves. Around this time, the first alternative electrodynamics was born with the help of quaternions (van Vlaenderen & Waser, 2001). Later, following K. Rębilas (Rębilas, 2008), it turned out that the experimental results can be explained within the framework of classical electrodynamics. 

The laws of the theory of electrodynamics were formulated in quaternion form. I would note that the English term “quaternion” was identified by the word “kvaternion”. Formalism shows that Maxwell's equations can be derived from only a single quaternion equation. I distinguish between modified and unmodified Maxwell equations according to whether or not the Lorenz gauge is applied. I present the shape of the quaternion as the continuity equation, generalizing the “traditional” continuity equation with three equations. A magneto scalar field set in equations that propagates at the speed of light. I lay the ground pillars of the static magneto scalar field. I also deal with magneto scalar waves, the energy conservation, the constitutive relations in vacuum, the invariance to the Lorentz transformation, the Lagrangian density and the Helmholtz theorem. What the theory predicts cannot occur in nature.

Keywords: quaternion, electrodynamics, magneto scalar potential
